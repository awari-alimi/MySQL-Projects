# MYSQL Projects Portfolio

Welcome to mySQL portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of MYSQL-based data analysis projects I've completed to demonstrate my skills in querying, data modeling, and business intelligence.

## Tools & Technologies
- **SQL** (MySQL)
- **Power BI** (for visualization)
- **Git & GitHub** (for version control)

## Projects Included

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| üìäSales Analysis (Beginner Project)| In this project, I performed a comprehensive sales data analysis using MySQL to uncover key business insights. The goal was to identify trends, top-performing products, customer behaviour, and regional performance. I used SQL to clean and query the data, calculate KPIs such as total revenue, average order value, and sales growth, and segment data by time, product, and geography. This analysis helps stakeholders make data-driven decisions to optimise sales strategies and improve customer engagement. |
|üé¨ Movie Ratings or E-commerce Orders (Beginner Project)| This project focuses on analysing movie ratings or e-commerce order data using SQL. I explored user behaviour, product popularity, and rating trends by writing queries to calculate average ratings, identify top-rated items, and analyse purchase frequency. This project demonstrates foundational SQL skills such as filtering, grouping, joining tables, and using aggregate functions. |
|üë• Customer Segmentation (Intermediate Project)|
In this project, I used SQL to segment customers based on their purchasing behaviour and demographics. I applied techniques like CASE statements, subqueries, and window functions to group customers into meaningful categories (e.g., high-value, frequent buyers). The goal was to support targeted marketing strategies and improve customer retention through data-driven insights.|
| üåç Carbon Emissions Analysis (Intermediate to Advanced Project)|
This project involved analysing global carbon emissions data to identify trends, key contributors, and seasonal patterns. Using SQL, I aggregated emissions by country, year, and source, and calculated growth rates over time. The analysis supports environmental awareness and policy-making by highlighting areas with the highest impact and change. 
| ‚öôÔ∏è SQL Optimisation or Data Warehousing (Advanced Project)|
This advanced project showcases my ability to work with large datasets and optimise SQL queries for performance. I designed a simplified data warehouse schema, implemented ETL logic, and used indexing and query tuning techniques to improve efficiency. This project demonstrates my understanding of database architecture, normalisation, and scalable data solutions. |
